# RustOS Implementation

This directory contains the initial implementation of RustOS, a hypervisor-native operating system written entirely in Rust.

```

## Implementation Status

Based on the design documents in `/docs`, the following components have been implemented:

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Kernel Components

- **Hypervisor Integration**: Basic hypervisor abstraction layer supporting KVM, Xen, and other hypervisors
- **Memory Management**: Rust-aware memory management with linked-list allocator
- **Capability System**: Foundation for capability-based security model with typed channels
- **Process Management**: Modern process model with async-first design
- **I/O Subsystem**: Device management framework with async I/O interfaces

### Key Features Implemented

1. **No-std Kernel**: Fully no_std compatible kernel that can run in hypervisor environments
2. **Async-First Architecture**: Built around Rust's async/await for optimal concurrency
3. **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Leveraging Rust's type system for compile-time correctness
4. **Capability Channels**: Revolutionary alternative to traditional syscalls
5. **Hypervisor Agnostic**: Abstraction layer for different hypervisor technologies

## Building

### Prerequisites
- Rust nightly toolchain
- LLVM/Clang for linking

### Build Commands

```bash
# Install nightly toolchain with required components
rustup install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly

# Build the kernel
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=core,alloc

# Check code (faster than full build)
cargo +nightly check
```

## Architecture

The RustOS kernel follows a hybrid microkernel architecture with the following layers:

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**: Hypervisor integration for virtualized environments
2. **Core Kernel**: Memory management, process scheduling, capability system
3. **System Services**: File system, network stack, device drivers (planned)
4. **Application Layer**: User applications communicating via capability channels

## Design Principles

- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system to eliminate memory safety bugs
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level interfaces with no runtime overhead
- **Capability-Based Security**: Replace traditional access control with capabilities
- **Hypervisor-First**: Designed for cloud and virtualized environments
- **Async Everything**: Non-blocking I/O and cooperative scheduling throughout

## Next Steps

The current implementation provides the foundation for the RustOS design. Next development phases will focus on:

1. **System Services**: File system, network stack, display server
2. **Device Drivers**: Hardware device support and driver framework
3. **User Space**: Application framework and runtime environment
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in hypervisor environments
5. **Tooling**: Development tools, debugger, profiler

## Testing

Currently, the kernel builds successfully for the `x86_64-unknown-none` target. Full testing requires a hypervisor environment such as QEMU/KVM.
