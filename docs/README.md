# Design Documentation

This directory contains design documents for the RustOS project - a hypervisor-native operating system written entirely in Rust.

## Documents

### [RustOS Design Document](rust-os-design.md)
The main design document outlining the architecture, goals, and implementation strategy for RustOS. This comprehensive document covers:

- Overall architecture and design principles
- Platform support (x86_64 focus)
- Hypervisor integration strategies
- Novel kernel/user mode interaction using capability channels
- Memory management with Rust-aware allocation
- Process and thread management
- I/O and device management
- Capability-based security model
- Development toolchain and deployment
- Future roadmap and research directions

## Key Innovations

RustOS introduces several innovative concepts:

1. **Capability Channels**: Replacing traditional syscalls with typed, async capability channels
2. **Hypervisor-First Design**: Optimized for virtualized environments rather than bare metal
3. **Rust-Aware Memory Management**: Leveraging Rust's ownership system for safe memory management
4. **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Minimizing data copying throughout the system
5. **Async-First I/O**: Built around Rust's async/await ecosystem

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for:
- Operating system researchers and developers
- Rust systems programmers
- Hypervisor and virtualization engineers
- Security researchers interested in capability-based systems
- Anyone interested in modern OS design principles

## Contributing

Design documents are living specifications that evolve with the project. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome through:
- GitHub issues for specific design questions
- Pull requests for documentation improvements
- Design discussions in project forums
